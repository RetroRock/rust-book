## The Rust Programming Language

_Source code from the official book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)._

This project should help me in the future to refresh my knowledge about certain Rust topics.

```Rust
fn main() {
    println!("Have fun, my fellow Rustacean!");
}
```
